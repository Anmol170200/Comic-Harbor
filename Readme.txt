## Project Description

This is a simple PHP application that accepts a visitor’s email address and emails them random XKCD comics every five minutes.

## About

1. Created a web page to take the user's name and email for verification.
2. Set up a database to store user information.
3. Verification emails are sent using SendGrid, with a verification code generated by `random_bytes()` and `bin2hex()`.
4. Users receive an alert to check their inbox for verification.
5. After clicking the verification link, the user’s email is verified in the database, and the first XKCD comic is sent.

### index.php

The signup page collects the user’s name and email and sends the data via `POST` to `subscribe.php`.

### connection.php

This file sets up the connection with the database, where the subscriber's information is stored.

### subscribe.php

This handles the user’s email and name submission, validates the email, and checks if the user already exists in the database. If the email is valid and not already in use, it sends a verification email.

### verify.php

This script verifies the user when they click on the link in the verification email. It also sends the first XKCD comic.

### unsubscribe.php

This handles the unsubscribe process by updating the database when the user clicks the unsubscribe link.

### cronjob.php

A cron job runs every five minutes to scrape a random XKCD comic and email it to the user.
